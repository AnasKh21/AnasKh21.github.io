# 👋 Hello, I’m **Anas Khayar**

I’m a **software and cybersecurity engineer** passionate about designing, developing, and securing digital systems.  
I build **secure, reliable, and efficient software** by combining my skills in **programming, cybersecurity, and formal methods**.  

I can design and develop **secure code** under **Zero Trust** principles, apply **unit and security testing**, and even use **formal verification** (Atelier B, model checking) to guarantee correctness and resilience.  
I have a **strong foundation in software development** with a **solid cybersecurity culture** — from **secure coding** and **DevOps automation** to **pentesting and incident analysis**.  

Curious, fast-learning, and adaptable, I enjoy exploring new technologies and continuously improving both my technical and analytical skills.

## 🧠 <a name="about"></a>About Me

I hold an **Engineering Degree in Software Engineering & Cybersecurity** from **ENSIIE (École Nationale Supérieure d’Informatique pour l’Industrie et l’Entreprise)**, part of **Institut Mines-Télécom** and **Université Paris-Saclay**.  
During my experiences, I worked on:
- Secure development and software automation in the automotive sector (AUTOSAR / UDS standard)
- Network intrusion detection, pentesting, and cybersecurity audits
- Secure backend development and authentication systems  

I am versatile — equally comfortable writing **Python scripts**, designing **web or Android applications**, or analyzing **security incidents** in simulated networks.
